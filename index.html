              12 James Webb Space Telescope findings that changed our
              understanding of the universe in 2023
            </h1>
            <p>
              The James Webb Space Telescope filled us with awe this year.
              Here's a look back on how. The James Webb Space Telescope filled
              us with awe this year. Here's a look back on how.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Christmas morning two years ago, astronomers and space fans
              received the gift they'd been waiting on for 30 years: the launch
              of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the world's biggest,
              most daring endeavor to probe the earliest stars and galaxies in
              the universe.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, the space observatory has continued to deliver
              breathtaking and scientifically valuable images of the cosmos.
              Here's a look back at the JWST discoveries that altered our
              understanding of the universe in 2023.
            </p>
            <h3>1. The JWST takes a fresh look at our solar system</h3>
            <img src="images/jupiter jwst.jpg" alt="Jupiter" />
            <p>
              Although the JWST's purpose is to see some of the first stars and
              galaxies in the universe, its fresh look at our own solar system
              has been nothing short of breathtaking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Take this image, which, in October, revealed a high-speed jet
              stream on Jupiter, previously unseen despite being over 3,000
              miles (4,800 kilometers) wide and traveling at about 320 mph (515
              km/h).
            </p>
            <p>
              And back in June, the JWST identified carbon dioxide in the salty
              liquid oceans of Jupiter's icy moon Europa for the first time. The
              space observatory also offered a new look at Saturn in this image,
              which captures the gas giant's delicate ring system and three of
              its 146 known moons. The gas giant is eerily dark when seen
              through the JWST's infrared eyes, because in this wavelength,
              "methane gas absorbs almost all of the sunlight falling on the
              atmosphere," according to NASA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The powerful observatory also captured this stunning image of
              Uranus, its brightest moons and 11 of its 13 known dusty rings.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Nearby exoplanet has abundant life-supporting molecules</h3>
            <img src="images/K2-18 b.webp" alt="K2-18 b" />
            <p>
              In September, the JWST discovered methane and carbon dioxide in
              the atmosphere of a fairly nearby exoplanet named K2-18 b, which
              circles a cool star 120 light-years from Earth and is larger than
              our planet but smaller than the giant planets in our solar system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope had
              indicated that K2-18 b may be s a "Hycean world," an exoplanet
              that hosts thick, hydrogen-rich atmospheres with oceans of liquid
              water underneath. Recent observations with the JWST support that
              hypothesis, as the new data shows evidence for abundant methane
              and carbon dioxide but little ammonia.
            </p>
            <p>
              "These results are the product of just two observations of K2-18
              b, with many more on the way," study co-author Savvas
              Constantinou, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge, said
              in a statement. "This means our work here is but an early
              demonstration of what Webb can observe in habitable-zone
              exoplanets."
            </p>
            <h3>3. The JWST discovers its smallest object yet</h3>
            <img
              src="images/irregularly shaped asteroid in deep space.jpg"
              alt="Irregularly shaped asteroid in deep space"
            />
            <p>
              In February, scientists were thrilled with the JWST's unexpected
              discovery of a small asteroid embedded in the main asteroid belt
              between Mars and Jupiter. Like most residents of that region, the
              space rock, which is about as tall as the Washington Monument, is
              thought to be a remnant of the formation of the solar system and
              thus contains tantalizing history about its evolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Asteroids less than a mile long are difficult to spot with other
              telescopes, so the find underscored the telescope's usefulness
              closer to home.
            </p>
            <h3>
              4. The JWST finds massive, mysterious galaxies in the infant
              universe
            </h3>
            <img src="images/six galaxies.jpg" alt="Six galaxies" />
            <p>
              In February, scientists announced the discovery of galaxies as
              massive as the Milky Way sprinkled across the JWST's images of the
              universe just 500 million to 700 million years after the Big Bang.
              From what existing theories and models tell us, the galaxies the
              JWST found are too big, and the mature red stars in them too old,
              that the study authors said the find "creates problems for
              science."
            </p>
            <p>
              "It calls the whole picture of early galaxy formation into
              question," study co-author Joel Leja, an astronomer at Penn State,
              said in a statement.
            </p>
            <h3>
              5. An intensifying debate over the universe's expansion rate
            </h3>
            <img
              src="images/spiral galaxy NGC 5584.jpg"
              alt="Spiral galaxy NGC 5584"
            />
            <p>
              We know that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate,
              but we don't know precisely how fast. The issue has become a
              debate centered on resolving the correct value of the Hubble
              constant, an important number for estimating the universe's
              expansion rate. Right now, model estimates for the Hubble constant
              don't agree with values based on telescope observations.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, the JWST observed a class of stars known as Cepheid
              variables, which are usually humongous stars some 100,000 times
              brighter than the sun and the most reliable source to measure
              cosmic distances (and thus to tease out the universe's expansion
              rate). But instead of resolving the debate, the JWST's data only
              deepened the ongoing debate over the Hubble constant.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I don't care what the value of the Hubble constant comes out to
              be," said Adam Riess, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University
              and a Nobel laureate. "I want to understand why our best tools —
              our gold standard tools — are not agreeing with each other."
            </p>
            <h3>
              6. Shining a spotlight on the first supermassive black holes
            </h3>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              This year, the JWST helped astronomers see starlight from two
              early galaxies where they think one of the first supermassive
              black holes emerged. The JWST observed the galaxies as they were
              when the universe was younger than 1 billion years, showing how,
              over time, black holes gain unfathomable masses — often millions
              or billions of times that of the sun.

            <h3>7. Complex organic molecules in a primordial galaxy</h3>
            <img src="images/distant galaxy .jpeg" alt="Distant galaxy" />
            <p>
              In June, astronomers revealed that the JWST had detected
              intriguing carbon-based molecules, similar to the ones found in
              oil and coal deposits on Earth, from over 12 billion years ago,
              when the universe was just 10% of its current age. In space, these
              molecules link to minuscule dust grains. Detecting them had been
              challenging because of the limits of our telescopes. However,
              "Webb really makes looking for organic molecules look too easy,"
              Justin Spilker, an astronomer at Texas A&M University, told
              Space.com.In June, astronomers revealed that the JWST had detected

            <h3>8. Yup, Maisie's galaxy is among the earliest ever spotted</h3>
            <img src="images/Maisie's galaxy.png" alt="Maisie's galaxy" />
            <p>
              This blurry orange blob, imaged by the JWST in summer 2022, is
              known as Maisie's galaxy, and in August 2023, astronomers
              announced that it's one of the earliest galaxies ever discovered.
              The galaxy seems to have existed when the universe was only 390
              million years old, making it one of the four earliest galaxies
              ever seen.
            </p>
            <p>
              "This was the undiscovered frontier where we really didn't know
              how the galaxies formed or what they looked like until we went and
              looked for them with the JWST," study author Steven Finkelstein,
              an astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin, told
              Space.com.
            </p>
            <h3>9. The most distant supermassive black hole ever seen</h3>

              alt="Over 100,00 galaxies"
            />
            <p>
              In July, astronomers announced that the JWST had detected the most
              distant active supermassive black hole ever seen, whose host
              galaxy formed just 570 million years after the Big Bang. However,
              this ancient black hole has puzzlingly low mass — just 9 million
              times that of the sun. For comparison, most of these cosmic beasts
              weigh over 1 billion solar masses. "It is still difficult to
              explain how it formed so soon after the universe began," the
              researchers said.

            <h3>10. The JWST rediscovers an ancient ghostly galaxy</h3>

            <p>
              The JWST's sighting of a fuzzy galaxy embedded deep inside a dust
              cloud has been of recent interest to astronomers, in part because
              it is seen as it appeared just 900 million years after the Big
              Bang, when the very first stars were appearing. But astronomers
              are also interested in the science lessons this galaxy is waiting
              to reveal, "potentially telling us there's a whole population of
              galaxies that have been hiding from us," Jed McKinney, an
              astronomer at the University of Texas at Austin, said in a
              statement.
            </p>
            <h3>11. The JWST spots 3 possible fabled "dark stars"</h3>
            <img

              alt="3 possible fabled dark stars"
            />
            <p>
              In July, astronomers reported that the JWST had found three bright
              objects that could possibly be "dark stars," a reference to the
              Grateful Dead song "Dark Star." The "stars" were originally tagged
              as galaxies by the JWST in 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              "When we look at the James Webb data, there are two competing
              possibilities for these objects," Katherine Freese, a professor of
              physics at The University of Texas at Austin, said in a statement.
              "One is that they are galaxies containing millions of ordinary,
              population-III stars. The other is that they are dark stars. And
              believe it or not, one dark star has enough light to compete with
              an entire galaxy of stars."
            </p>
            <p>
              Astronomers think these types of stars are powered by dark matter,
              the elusive substance that makes up 85% of the matter in our
              universe but is invisible to telescopes. If dark stars really do
              exist, their presence would help solve the puzzling observations
              of how a very young universe grew to host so many large galaxies
              as observed by the JWST, researchers say.
            </p>
            <h3>
              12. The earliest galaxies looked surprisingly similar to our Milky
              Way
            </h3>
            <img
              src="images/the newly discovered Milky Way-like galaxies.jpg"
              alt="The newly discovered Milky Way-like galaxies"
            />
            <p>
              Galaxy evolution theories have predicted that the earliest
              galaxies in our universe were too young to flaunt any noticeable
              features, like spiral arms, bars or rings; astronomers have
              thought these more complex structures began appearing about 6
              billion years after the Big Bang. But this year, the JWST found
              that galaxies with such delicate shapes could have existed as
              early as 3.7 billion years after the Big Bang.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Based on our results astronomers must rethink our understanding
              of the formation of the first galaxies and how galaxy evolution
              occurred over the past 10 billion years," study co-author
              Christopher Conselice, a professor of astronomy at the University
              of Manchester in the U.K., said in a statement.
